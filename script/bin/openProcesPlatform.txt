diasporachangemakers.net is an open project 


ideally it will also become colaborative


the intention is to create environment where active individuals while pursuing their aims are being exposed to practices of "open source" communities and modern web technologies 


by maintaining a digital forefront of the project or aim they are pursuing


we aim to put the creators in the middle of their creation


as a product and as a process


web development today is by all means special to us all


we are all part of it


we are the internet of things


some more consciously than others


but we all take part in digital revolution


to paraphrase a classical work of art



we are all "users" recently


in which case... I am off to help Tron!! it's going to be fun!!!


but seriously I want to invite you on a route to become more conscious user


and at least try to understand Tron and his way of doing stuff


you risk nothing


you learn a lot


this platform gives you a possibility to make mistakes


and learn from them


especially those most difficult ones


*//



we are the internet of things


a platform built by those who use it
